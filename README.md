Our project is focused on transforming the way people select music by using a chatbot that recommends songs based on the user's emotions in real time. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP), we can offer personalized music suggestions that match how the user is feeling at that moment. This approach addresses the limitations of current music recommendation systems and aims to create a more exciting, emotion-driven experience for users through the convenience of a chatbot.
